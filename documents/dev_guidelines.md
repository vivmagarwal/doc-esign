# Development Guidelines and Standards

## Software Development Best Practices - TechCorp Solutions

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the development standards and guidelines that all developers must follow when creating software for TechCorp Solutions. These guidelines ensure code quality, maintainability, security, and consistency across all projects.

**Purpose**: Establish consistent development practices across all teams and projects
**Scope**: Applies to all software development activities including web, mobile, and backend systems
**Compliance**: Mandatory for all developers, contractors, and third-party contributors

### 2. Code Quality Standards

**2.1 General Principles**
- Write clean, readable, and self-documenting code
- Follow the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Keep functions and methods small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write code for humans to read, not just computers to execute

**2.2 Code Complexity**
- Maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10 per function
- Maximum function length of 50 lines (excluding comments)
- Maximum file length of 500 lines
- Maximum class size of 300 lines
- Avoid deeply nested code (maximum 3 levels of nesting)

**2.3 Naming Conventions**
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Variables: camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript, snake_case for Python
- Constants: UPPER_CASE with underscores
- Classes: PascalCase in all languages
- Functions: should be verbs or verb phrases (e.g., calculateTotal, getUserById)
- Boolean variables: should start with is, has, or can (e.g., isValid, hasPermission)

### 3. Version Control Practices

**3.1 Git Workflow**
- Use Git Flow or GitHub Flow depending on project requirements
- Main/Master branch always contains production-ready code
- Develop branch for integration of features
- Feature branches created from develop (feature/feature-name)
- Hotfix branches created from main/master (hotfix/issue-description)
- Release branches for preparing releases (release/version-number)

**3.2 Commit Standards**
- Write meaningful commit messages following conventional commits format
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Example: `feat(auth): add password reset functionality`
- Commits should be atomic and focused on a single change
- Include ticket/issue number in commit message when applicable

**3.3 Branch Naming**
- feature/JIRA-123-user-authentication
- bugfix/JIRA-456-fix-login-error
- hotfix/JIRA-789-critical-security-patch
- release/v2.1.0
- Always include ticket number when available

### 4. Code Review Requirements

**4.1 Pull Request Process**
- All code must be reviewed before merging to main branches
- Minimum of 2 approvals required for production code
- PR description must include purpose, changes made, and testing performed
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Link related tickets or issues
- Ensure all CI/CD checks pass before review

**4.2 Review Checklist**
- Code follows style guidelines and conventions
- Adequate test coverage (minimum 80%)
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Performance implications considered
- Documentation updated if needed
- No commented-out code or debug statements
- Error handling is appropriate
- Database migrations are reversible

### 5. Testing Standards

**5.1 Test Coverage Requirements**
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for critical business logic
- All public APIs must have integration tests
- UI components must have unit tests
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

**5.2 Types of Testing**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure response times meet SLA requirements
- **Security Tests**: Validate against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

**5.3 Test Naming Convention**
```javascript
// Format: should_expectedBehavior_when_stateUnderTest
test('should_returnUserData_when_validIdProvided', () => {
  // test implementation
});
```

### 6. Security Guidelines

**6.1 Authentication and Authorization**
- Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for API authentication
- Implement proper session management
- Use multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

**6.3 Secrets Management**
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Utilize secret management tools (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Different credentials for each environment

### 7. API Design Standards

**7.1 RESTful Principles**
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Resource-based URLs (nouns, not verbs)
- Use proper status codes (2xx success, 4xx client error, 5xx server error)
- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Version APIs using URL path (/api/v1) or headers

**7.2 API Documentation**
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Document all endpoints, parameters, and responses
- Include example requests and responses
- Specify rate limits and authentication requirements
- Keep documentation synchronized with code

**7.3 Response Format**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // actual response data
  },
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 8. Database Guidelines
